# My Techdegree Project 4: Web Style Guide
 
https://mbhalesha.github.io/techdegree-project-4-web-style-guide/

For this project, I was provided a completed index.html and styles.css files. I converted the CSS into Sass by splitting the code into several Sass partial files. I stored values in Sass variables and created mixins. I added breakpoint locations for media queries, added Sass Map and List, added parent and nested selectors in multiple places with "&", and utilized the modular file approach. I now have a useful Sass micro-framework to quickly prototype other websites.
